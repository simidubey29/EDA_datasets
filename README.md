## 📌 Project Title

**Movies and TV Shows on Netflix – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

> ✅ This project clearly falls under **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** as it focuses on understanding, cleaning, and visualizing the Netflix dataset to uncover patterns and insights.

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the popular **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset**. The goal is to analyze Netflix content based on various attributes such as:

* Type of content (Movies vs TV Shows)
* Release year
* Ratings
* Country
* Duration

EDA helps in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, and visualizing trends before applying any machine learning or advanced analytics.
